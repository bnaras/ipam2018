We can only cover some important aspects of RStudio here. There are
a number of resources online, including Youtube videos that you can
consult.

When you start RStudio, you will get a view similar to what is shown
below with perhaps slight differences.

One can type commands directly into the console window and see
results. For example, go ahead and type `1+1` to use R as a calculator
and see the result. However, one often wants to write a sequence of
commands, execute them and possibly save the commands to run them
again another time. That's what the editor window is for. You can type
a series of commands into the editor window and RStudio will offer to
save them when you quit, and bring them back when you restart RStudio.

If you type
```{r}
x = 1 + 1
y = 2 * x
z <- (x + y)
```
into the editor window, you can press the `Run` arrow shown and
execute each line in the R console, one by one. The figure below shows
this and as new variables are created, the workspace panel displays
them.

### Help

A lot of help is available in RStudio in the help tab that you should
feel free to investigate. We merely point out a few.

When anyone installs R, there is a set of recommended packages that is
always installed. So your _installed packages_ will reflect that. As
we proceed, you will have to install many packages and that list will,
of course, grow.

### Installing Packages

There are world-wide R package repositories or Comprehensive R Archive
Network (CRAN) sites that allow packages to be downloaded and
installed. You almost never have to directly work with them since
RStudio makes it easy to install the packages as shown in the figure
below, where we have clicked on the __Packages__ tab and clicked on
the _Install_ button. Note how as you type the name of a package, you
get auto-completion. (In fact, RStudio provides auto-completion even
as you type R commands, showing you various options you can use for
the commands!)

#### Activity

At this point, you should go ahead and install the `dplyr`
package. Press all the buttons necessary to make the install happen.
After you have done the installation, go back to the __Help__ tab
where you can click on the _Installed Packages_ link shown in the
figure below.

####
Navigate to the `dplyr` link and click on it so that you get to the
help on the `dplyr` package. Two kinds of help are displayed:
_Documentation_ and _Help Pages_.

####
The _Help Pages_ document facilities that the package `dplyr` in
detail. The _Documentation_ is often more useful, because they can
contain user guides and _vignettes_ that are very useful for people
learning about the package. So click on the _User guides..._

####
Click on the _Introduction to dplyr_ vignette to see the vignette.

####
_Vignettes, when present, are indispenable in learning
about a package._ Not all packages provide vignettes, however!

### Workspace

As you use RStudio more, you will find yourself creating variables
(like `x`, `y`, `z` above, except far more valuable) and it is
desirable to save them. When you quit RStudio, you will be given a
choice of saving your workspace. It is worth doing so if you have
important things created.

RStudio also a notion of projects and so you can keep project
workspaces separate. Each such project can be designated a working
folder so that `x` from one workspace does not clobber `x` from
another. You can explore these options via the _File_ menu.
