# Introduction

[R language](https://www.r-project.org) implementations are freely
available for Macs and Windows and and can be installed from any of
the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) mirrors. RStudio is an IDE
(Integrated Development Environment) for R and is also available in a
free version.

1. Go to the [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/) website and download
   it for your Mac or PC. (We assume no one is using Linux; if you are
   that advanced, then you already know what to do!)

2. Install the free
   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
   version.

RStudio makes it very easy to learn and use R, providing a number of
useful features that many find indispensable.

## R Packages to run examples

To run the examples we talk about today, you nee some packages to be
installed. In the R console in Rstudio, you can execute what's below. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
options(repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com")
install.packages(c("distcomp", "homomorpheR", "CVXR"))
```
