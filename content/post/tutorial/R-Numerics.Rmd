### Matrices

The function `matrix` can be used for creating matrices which are
two-dimensional arrays.

```{r}
## Create a 3 by 2 matrix.
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 3)
m
```

Another way is to use existing vectors to _bind_ into a matrix.
```{r}
xx <- 1:3
yy <- 4:6
## Bind by columns
(m2 <- cbind(xx, yy))
## Bind by rows
(m3 <- rbind(xx, yy))
```

The matrix `m2` has the same content as `m` above, but the columns
have names `xx` and `yy` which can be used in subsetting/indexing.

```{r}
## Access element in row 1, column 2
m[1, 2]
## Access second column
m[ , 2]
## Do the same with matrix m2
m2[, "yy"]
## Access the third row of m
m[3, ]
```
