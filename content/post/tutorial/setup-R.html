<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.r-project.org">R language</a> implementations are freely available for Macs and Windows and and can be installed from any of the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) mirrors. RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R and is also available in a free version.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Go to the <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/">CRAN</a> website and download it for your Mac or PC. (We assume no one is using Linux; if you are that advanced, then you already know what to do!)</p></li>
<li><p>Install the free <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">RStudio</a> version.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>RStudio makes it very easy to learn and use R, providing a number of useful features that many find indispensable.</p>
